            operation should run, False if it shouldnâ€™t run, or None if the router has no opinion.
            The app_label positional argument is the label of the application being migrated.
            model_name is set by most migration operations to the value of model._meta.model_name (the lowercased
            version of the model __name__) of the model being migrated. Its value is None for the RunPython and RunSQL
            operations unless they provide it using hints.
            hints are used by certain operations to communicate additional information to the router.
            When model_name is set, hints normally contains the model class under the key 'model'. Note that it may be a
            historical model, and thus not have any custom attributes, methods, or managers. You should only rely on
            _meta.
            This method can also be used to determine the availability of a model on a given database.
            makemigrations always creates migrations for model changes, but if allow_migrate() returns False, any
            migration operations for the model_name will be silently skipped when running migrate on the db. Changing
            the behavior of allow_migrate() for models that already have migrations may result in broken foreign keys,
            extra tables, or missing tables. When makemigrations verifies the migration history, it skips databases
            where no app is allowed to migrate.
